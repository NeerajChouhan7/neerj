Of course, music is also art. Best one, actually. No wonder how we travel through time when we come across good music. Good music is not rare. Actually, it is not a thing. Everyone has their own tastes. And accordingly, they vibe to it. But the more interesting thing is how it all started? What made humans come up with something like music? Let's listen to this written symphony together...\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI don't believe that there was a discovery or invention of music. Of course, earlier homo sapiens were dancing around a fire on music. Nowadays, we believe music is a social and cultural construct. But John Blacking an ethnomusicologist, who studies music, proposed that singing and dancing preceded homo sapiens by several hundred thousand years. There is musicality in our brain. There is a unique recognition for music. It has always been there in the rustling of leaves, flowing water of a river, birds chirping and all-around in nature. No matter, it is quite evident that there is a strong connection between music and human brain. Which makes us groove on the beats. Dancing mindlessly, okay not in public, but who doesn't dance to their favorite song in the shower. You are sort of high when you listen to good music. What is this thing?\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are in a flow state when you are listening to your favorite song. Your mood shifts by music. Music is hands down the best mood shifter in the world. It has the power to change your emotions by making you feel a certain way. You can feel all kinds of emotions by listening to music. Literally all kinds of emotions. You listen to music when you are feeling something. Sometimes, music makes you feel something when you feeling nothing. And sometimes it shows you feelings you once had, but lost touch with. Giving you emotions and feeling to the extent of coping with anxiety and depression.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven from all of our personal experience music can change moods for all of us. Music is there for us like a comforting parent, in times of despair. Many artists have come up in public to say that their music helps people who are in depression. Many people come around to say that someone's music helped them to go through tough times. The same kind of thing is your mood making you listen to certain kinds of music. And music making you feel a certain way. Not only in just one physical sense but many more like smell.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusic has fragrance. I certainly believe that. Musicians have said once in while that they remember the fragrance of the music when they wrote it. Sometimes when you hear an old song, you must have remembered how it felt when you heard it the very first time. I have also heard, people associating colors with music. They see certain colors which are unexplainable when they listen to or produce music. How goddamn interesting it is!\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe, a German poet said that ****\"Music is liquid architecture; architecture is frozen music\". Nature is chaotic, music is audible order. Talking about order, national anthems are songs uniting the whole country together. The fact that there is around 2 hours of music on Golden Record on Voyager 1 but the whole science on spacecraft could be summarized in just 10 equations. Music is tied to our motor system. I mean, it is possible that you can remember nothing but music.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClive wearing was a musician, who had his memory erased because of a brain infection. He remembered everything in past but he was left with only 30 seconds of short-term memory. In an attempt to regain control, he started keeping a journal. But that turned into havoc because after writing something he used to forget that did it actually happened or not. His wife tried a lot to help him with his problem. The only thing that was normal in his life was music. His symptoms disappeared while playing music. The momentum or the flow state makes him forgets about his disease. His brain tricks itself while he is playing music. He played each and every note perfectly. That's the wonderful power of music. But what if you can't hear music?\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is physically impossible for you to hear music. Not like you had the senses but lost it, but you never had it in the first place. Basically, someone who is deaf from birth. Now here's the interesting part: those who can't hear it, can feel it. Yep, the information of music is processed same in the brain of a deaf person & normal person. Even without the physical ability to hear something, they can actually neurologically feel it. Babies don't understand words or language initially. But they sleep to lullaby, they have tonality in the calling 'ma-MA' or 'da-DA'\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt ensures that there is no language in music. Best example of this is that a Spanish song, Despacito has 7.4 Billion views on YouTube. Even the first song in my playlist is an Italian/French song. You don't have to actually understand something, in order to feel it. No barrier of language in music brings all the humans on the same page. Still, It's super hard to find people who have the same music taste as you. Interestingly, you mostly vibe with people who have the same music taste as you. Personally, I haven't found myself vibing with a person, who likes music which I do not. And if I meet someone with the same music taste, we'll instantly vibe and vice versa. As long as you have music, you cannot be alone.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusic can make you imagine scenarios that have never happened, or to be exact which you want to happen. There are some songs that are close to us at some point in time. And when you go back to them after a while, you are most likely to feel all those emotions again. That's the nostalgia of music. Sometimes, music makes you feel things you have never felt before.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome songs hurt...but in the best way possible.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\nP.S.

Nature is how your genes affect your behavior & personality traits in your life. It is more on the biological aspect of life. Nurture can be called a product of your exposure, experience, and learnings. \r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe debate is regarding whether an individual's personality traits & abilities are in born or it comes through experience i.e. it is by nature or nurture. There are obvious sets of characteristics in an individual to divide into both of these. For example color of hair, eyes are hereditary in progeny. But if you are completely healthy then your communications skills are solely based on nurture.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe psychological traits and development of a human being are shaped by a balance of genetic influence and experience in life. Because there are too many facts on both of these extremes. It is widely accepted that both genes & environment do not act independently on an individual. But they interact with each other in a very complex manner in development.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n                         <hr/>\r\n                    <h5>Signaling</h5>\r\n                    <p>A short fun video on Virtue Signalling on Social Media: <a href='https://youtu.be/ohm9C4u63qk'>https://youtu.be/ohm9C4u63qk</a></p>\r\n                    <p>Sometimes Virtue Signalling can be a powerful tool, as a business or a personal brand: <a href='https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/dont-be-afraid-to-virtue-signal-it-can-be-a-powerful-tool-to-change-peoples-minds.html'>https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/dont-be-afraid-to-virtue-signal-it-can-be-a-powerful-tool-to-change-peoples-minds.html</a></p>\r\n                    <p>Very interesting read on signals, and countersignals: <a href='https://www.robkhenderson.com/past-newsletter/countersignals'>https://www.robkhenderson.com/past-newsletter/countersignals</a></p>\r\n                    <p>Interesting neuroscientific and psychological take to deal with anger: <a href='https://thinkingbat.substack.com/p/tame-the-beast'>https://thinkingbat.substack.com/p/tame-the-beast</a></p>\r\n                    <p>Studying Phineas Gage has been quite an important part of neurology and psychology.

The way our brain makes this into order is more complex and interesting than you could have possibly imagined. Whenever you listen to a song, your auditory cortex converts rhythms, melodies, and harmonies into a sensible piece. Then our reaction to the music depends upon how we interact with it. Singing it in your head, activates your premotor cortex, responsible for movements. Dance with it and your neurons will be in sync with the beats of the music. Pay attention to the lyrics and you'll activate your parietal cortex, which helps you maintain attention to different stimuli. Listening to a song that triggers personal memories? Your prefrontal cortex, which maintains personal life and relationships information, will spring into action. \r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nBrain imagining studies have shown that the more we like a song, the more we get treated with neurochemical bliss in our brain. Flooding us with similar chemical, cocaine gives. Don't worry that doesn't mean it is harmful. Interestingly, between the age of 12 to 22, our brains undergo neaurological development — the music we love during that time gets wired into our system for good. When our brain connected heightened emotion of young age to those songs, creating a stronger memory. Furthermore, with the help of puberty growth hormones, our brain label these memories as incredibly important ones.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nAuthor of This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession Daniel Levitin, notes that the music of our teenage years is connected with our social lives, too. “We are discovering music on our own for the first time when we’re young,” he said, “often through our friends. We listen to the music they listen to as a badge, as a way of belonging to a certain social group. That melds the music to our sense of identity.”\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nAnother reason why these memories stick with you, for the rest of your life is that you become *you*  in the period between ages of 12 to 22. They become an integral part of your sense of self. Firstly, some songs become attached to what we were feeling at that time.

Taking a two-week vacation means missing out on 15 airdrops, 7 NFT collections, and 3 Defi protocols with dope, new technology.\r\n                <br /><br />\r\nIf you are completely new to the world of web3, start with <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SWJw_NTyUvgdB_asRzsnVyKjciW8dZbeqQeUeWsEiQc/edit'>this document</a>.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBefore getting into the introduction, let’s have a quick look at the background of the protocol and understand why was even there a need for Timeswap?\r\n\r\nAs of this writing, the total value locked (TVL) in Defi is more than 100 Billion US dollars. With around half of it, locked in lending protocols like AAVE, Compound, etc. These protocols have become strong pillars for lending and borrowing in Defi with their groundbreaking innovation in the past few years. For example Uniswap’s defining moment in the Defi in 2018 with the first Automated Market Maker(AMM). Built upon the concept of liquidity pools. They enabled permissionless exchange between any ERC-20 tokens which opened up liquidity for long-tail assets. Or in June 2020, when Compound introduced liquidity mining through their governance token. \r\n\r\nIn spite of all these innovations, they have their inefficiency and shortcomings.\r\n\r\nOracle attacks have drained millions from the Defi ecosystem. It remains a significant roadblock for scaling and securing protocols. Timeswap aims to build an oracle-less, fully decentralized AMM-based money market protocol, with the vision of becoming the on-chain source of truth in Defi. With other promising features in the roadmap and in development, I am super excited to dive deeper into Timeswap and its vision. Let’s go:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>Introduction</h5>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nDefi protocols aim to replace banks. Having no centralized entity to come around the user’s assets is the ethos of Defi. And Timeswap is a protocol built strongly around that ethos.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nLet’s go back to the future, to the genesis of the name: Timeswap. Timeswap name implies users swapping tokens through time. They allow users to decide the future price of the asset vs collateral while deciding their risk vs return too. But how exactly? Let’s see:\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTimeswap is a decentralized AMM-based market maker protocol that is self-sufficient and works without the need for oracles or liquidators. It allows anyone to do fixed maturity lending & borrowing of any ERC20 token with any other ERC20 token as collateral. The protocol was created with the vision to create a fully permissionless, oracle-less lending & borrowing just like Uniswap is for decentralized exchanges. Do not worry if you don’t understand any of the words mentioned here, I’m going to come back to each of them. Starting with AMM.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>What is AMM</h5>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAutomated market maker, also known as AMM, is an algorithm that allows digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automated way. Instead of traditional order books, we use liquidity pools in the market.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nLiquidity pools are collections of funds locked digitally in a smart contract. People supply the tokens they hold in liquidity pools. All the providers of tokens are called liquidity providers. When they deposit their tokens, they receive liquidity provider tokens, also called LP Token.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe main difference between oracle-less and oracles-including AMMs is that in the oracles less one, the interest rates & collateral factors of pools are determined by unique 3 variable constant product AMM rather than based on any price oracle. Instead of the protocol, the market participants normalize the interest rates and collateral requirements based on the prevailing market conditions.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nComing back to AMMs, different protocols use AMM in their own ways. Balancer uses constant mean formula, by which they include up to 8 tokens into pools. On top of that, it allows adaptive fees structure too, that can react to market forces like volatility or demand. Uniswap which is an oracle-less decentralized exchange uses constant product AMM with their equation X*Y = K. Timeswap’s AMM is very similar to Uniswap’s, let’s see how:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h6>Timeswap AMM</h6>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTimeswap’s AMM is a constant product automated market maker. There is constant K which is the sum of the value of three X, Y & Z tokens that we are using in this particular automated market. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nIt works on the basis of these 3 variables: X (Principal Pool), Y (Interest Rate Pool), and Z (Collateral Factor Pool). These three variables determine the interest rate and collateral factor required to interact with the pools.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nXYZ = K<br /><br />\r\n\r\nX = Principal Pool. It is where lenders & liquidity providers deposit their assets.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nY = Interest Rate Pool. This pool decides the interest rate on the maturity of that pool such that Y/X is equal to the max. interest / second.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nZ = Collateral factor pool. A collateral factor is a predefined number that defines the amount of collateral you can borrow against your asset. Z/X ratio decides the minimum collateralized debt position (CDP) of a pool.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBefore understanding these variables further, let’s first see what are APR and CDP mentioned above.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAPR i.e. annual percentage rate is the expected yearly interest rate to be paid by the borrower. Also, the expected yearly yield received by the lender.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nCDP is a collateralized debt position. Which is the amount of collateral locked per unit of asset borrowed for the borrower. It means, what is the value of the collateral given by borrower with respect to the asset that they have borrowed, in simplest units.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nFor lenders, it is the collateral coverage per unit of asset lent. This also basically means, how much the collateral would cover if they lent it to the borrowers.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nLet’s understand this relationship with an example:\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTanmay wants to create a DAI-ETH pool with a maturity of 6 months. He wants to lock 10,000 DAI, expecting an annual return of 15% and a CDP of 167%.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nX will be 10000 DAI.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nY will be expected annual interest i.e. 15% upon the number of seconds in a year i.e. 31556926s.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nY/X = 0.0000475, this is our max interest/second of that pool.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nZ = value of ETH in DAI. Let’s say the price of ETH at the time of pool creation was 4000DAI, the value of Z would be 10000 * 1.67/4000 = 4.175 ETH\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo, now the pool is initialized by Tanmay with duration of 6 months with constant K = 1.98, X = 10,000, Y = 0.0000475, Z = 4.16\r\n<br /><br />\r\nFor now, hang on to this relation, we will simplify it even further in lending and borrowing. Even if you didn’t get much here, don’t worry, it’ll be piece of cake for you in the lending and borrowing section.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>Timeswap features:</h5>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTimeswap protocol is bringing lots of benefits and features to users, which has not been possible before on any Defi protocol. We will dive deeper into each of those features and understand how as a user you can leverage those features for the best. Before jumping into them, it’s important to understand the native tokens Timeswap allows for both their lenders and borrowers.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTimeswap Native tokens\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTimeswap has its native token which is given to both borrowers and lenders: Bond and Insurance tokens. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nBond tokens or BTs are issued to the lender who deposits their assets. They are ERC20 tokens representing the yield claim on that asset. They account for the principal plus interest owed after maturity to the lenders. After maturity of the pool, BT can be redeemed for the exact amount of underlying assets in the asset pool. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nInsurance one represents the insurance coverage with the time decaying properties. They are issued to lenders to hedge against the unavailability of the assets that are redeemable for BT. Basically, If the BTs fail to retrieve the equivalent amount lent out to the pool, the ITs issued will make up for this. They do it by allowing the lender to claim insurance coverage on the collateral defaulted by the borrowers.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>\r\nPermission-less fixed maturity lending & borrowing\r\n</h5>\r\nBut why fixed-term maturity?\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWith the factor of their AMM interest rates, pools have a fixed maturity. They are designed such that for borrowers who have not repaid their loans after maturity, their collateral gets proportionately distributed amongst lenders based on their insurance token holding. It de-risks the pool and lenders’ assets.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn several lending and borrowing protocols, which do not have fixed maturity, the collateral gets liquidated if the borrower does not pay the debt before the debt’s value goes below the collateral’s value. As a result, lenders get the token at a discount called a liquidation discount.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMessari researcher John argues that right now fixed-rate lending is important primitives underpinning the global financial system. It provides certainty for both lenders and borrowers to accurately forecast their returns.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nJohn also mentioned a yield curve inversion. Which happens when investors are willing to lock in low long-term rates as they expect a more severe downturn. In traditional finance, this leads to central banks lowering interest rates and another indicator can be used to predict recessions. At the moment, we lack that in the Defi ecosystem.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn order to understand long-term investor sentiments, it’s important to have stable and predictable financial markets. MakerDAO has proposed a protocol Pairwyse to do this in Defi space. As this is under MakerDAO, they achieve this by facilitating fixed-rate agreements between DAI borrowers and lenders in a decentralized manner.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTimeswap achieves this by using the constant product AMM. That begs the question of how they prevent the time decay of the asset. We will see around the end of this piece how that is taken care of. For now, let’s jump into how does understand permission-less fixed maturity lending and borrowing further:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>Lending</h5>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn the world today, lending works something like this: We go to an institution to borrow against collateral.  Based on your banking history, the interest rate will be decided upon that loan. Bank takes their cut in between and gives us the loan.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nNow let’s see how does lending works in the Defi world. We go to a platform with our digital assets. That public decentralized platform connects lenders and borrowers. You borrow against your digital assets. Based on mathematics, the algorithm, the interest rate is decided on your loan. All transactions are transparent and permissionless.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nNow we come to how lending works in Timeswap. As usual Defi protocol, lenders add liquidity/assets to the pool. As a result, it increases the X variable in our XYZ = K equation. To maintain the constant K, Y & Z decreases in value. Which reduces the next lender’s interest rates and also collateralized debt position. In easiest languages, the interest rate (Y) & collateralized debt position (CDP, also Z) are inversely proportional to the principal pool (X). As more assets are provided into the pool, interest rate and CDP decrease.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAfter the pool is initialized, other users can lend their assets to that pool. Things get interesting because even though they are not the ones who created the pool, they can still decide their own risk and reward by that pool. They have the ability to customize interest rates on that pool. Let’s understand this with an example:\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTanmay wants to deposit 1000 DAI to the pool one month before the pool maturity. With the help of an algorithm, the protocol comes up with an APR ranging from 0.84% to 13.41%. Tanmay chooses 10% APR with some insurance while initiating the transaction. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nAs a result, he receives 1008.19 Bond tokens and 0.474 Insurance tokens. At the end of 1 month, he receives 1008.19 DAI by burning his Bond tokens. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nHowever if his bond tokens are not able to give him exact same amount of DAI, his insurance tokens will be burned in order to provide him a proportional percentage of coverage on insurance value. Which is in line with the percentage of unrealized assets from bond tokens.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nInteresting trivia: we know that the maturity of the pool is totally decided by the user. But by code, the maximum time duration for a pool is about 136 years which is exactly the max of uint32 in seconds. Let’s understand how can you borrow within that period of 136 years:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>Borrowing</h5>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAfter the lenders have provided the liquidity resulting in an increase in X. Borrowers will borrow from that liquidity, which will decrease X. As we discussed earlier X is inversely proportional to Y & Z. So, if X decrease, interest rate, and CDP will increase. Continuing the ritual, let’s understand with an example:\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTanmay borrowed 1000 DAI from the pool that had 1 month remaining in maturity. He deposited 0.654 ETH as collateral. When Tanmay repays 1008.2 DAI before the maturity of the pool, he will receive his collateral back. But if he defaults on the borrowing, his locked collateral of 0.654 ETH will be proportionately distributed to the lenders based on the insurance tokens lenders hold.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo, in a typical Defi borrowing setup, the collateral gets liquidated if the borrower does not pay the debt in time. As a result, lenders get the token at a discount called a liquidation discount. But in Timeswap, if borrowers do not pay the debt before the maturity time, their collateral gets distributed to the lenders instead of being liquidated.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWith the typical borrowing, Timeswap allows lots of opportunities to the users like shorting the tokens without risk of getting liquidated, leveraging any ERC20 token, borrowing against the LP tokens to borrow more LP tokens aka LP farming, and several more. Let’s dive deeper into one of those features which is arbitrage trading:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>What is Arbitrage?</h5>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn the easiest language, it means buying at a low price and selling high. Except, it is the result of market inefficiencies. It’s a bug more than a feature. It both exploits and addresses such inefficiencies. All crypto exchanges do not have one source of truth. Their methods to determine the value of the blockchain asset differ. As a result of that, there are differences in their prices too. Arbitrage trading refers to earning profit from this variance at prices among exchanges.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn Timeswap pools, they expect arbitrageurs (people who do arbitrage trading) to normalize the interest rates & CDP to the market values. It is also the mechanism by which Uniswap maintains its exchange prices as close to market prices, as possible.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nYou can leverage Timeswap pools using arbitrage techniques by taking advantage of other Defi protocols such as Aave, Compound, or Yield Protocol. If the lending rates on Timeswap are higher compared to other protocols, you can borrow from the external market and lend to Timeswap pools. Profiting from the difference in the lending rates and earning the interest rate. Similarly, on the borrowing side, you can profit from the imbalance between markets.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSimilarly, you can arbitrage between two Timeswap pools too. Consider the above DAI-MATIC pools. You can borrow from the pool with a lower interest rate and lend into the pool with the higher interest rate to get~5% profit on this trade. Given that both pools have similar maturity, the users stand to make a profit. However, if the pools have wider maturities, then users have to take into account the time preference as well while arbitraging.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h6>Oracle-less</h6>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTimeswap is an oracle-less Defi protocol. Now let’s see what an oracle is:\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOracle is a bridge between on-chain and off-chain worlds. They act as a tool to obtain external off-chain data into blockchains or smart contracts. External data could be TVL, token prices, interest rates, etc. Ideally, they should be decentralized. But in several protocols, centralized oracles are in work too.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTimeswap gives the reason that they are not fully decentralized and if so they are susceptible to manipulation. There have been oracles attacks on Defi protocols like Compound and Harvest, where they have lost $90 Million and $24 million, respectively.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nNow other Defi protocols use the external information given by the exchanges for their interest rates and APYs. But Timeswap uses constant product AMM to determine the interest rates and collateral factor.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWith the factor of their AMM interest rates, pools have a fixed maturity. They are designed such that for borrowers who have not repaid their loans after maturity, their collateral gets proportionately distributed amongst lenders based on their insurance token holding.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn near future, Timeswap aims to become a source of truth i.e. an on-chain decentralized oracle. Uniswap has been a proof that one can design efficient systems without needing external price oracles.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h6>Non-liquidatable loans\r\n</h6><br /><br />\r\nThe loans taken by the borrower on Timeswap do not get liquidated by the protocol. So, in a typical Defi borrowing setup, the collateral gets liquidated if the borrower does not pay the debt in time. As a result, lenders get the token at a discount called a liquidation discount. But in Timeswap, if borrowers do not pay the debt before the maturity time, their collateral gets distributed to the lenders instead of being liquidated.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h6>Market-driven interest & collateral</h6>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAs the users interact with protocol, with the help of the equation, the interest rates, and collateral required to keep changing for each transaction. This dynamic behavior of the protocol ensures risk management and capital efficiency on the oracle-less technology as compared to other protocols.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h6>Undercollateralization</h6>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAnother way users can leverage the arbitrage opportunity is by under collateralization. Right now, because of the collateral factor, loans in Defi are over collateralized. You can only borrow a certain amount on your collateral based on that asset’s collateral factor. Timeswap goes against that norm by allowing undercollateralized loans. As a borrower, you can borrow from one of the markets which are under collateralized and lend that asset to another market that is enough collateralized.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nUnder collateralization is a situation when a borrower is able to take a loan with a position such that the amount of collateral value locked is less than the amount of loan value you take from the protocol. This situation arises when CDP is low in a certain pool. Hence, their insurance coverage is also low. As a result, the lender is at high default risk. On other hand, borrowers can arbitrage this by taking out loans till the CDP maintains itself by the constant product algorithm we discussed earlier.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nFor eg for a DAI-ETH pool on Timeswap if the CDP value is 7000 DAI per ETH it’s an undercollateralized loan position for a borrower and hence a clear arbitrage.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWell, if the CDP is low then at some point it has to be back to normal too, right. So once the borrower takes out a loan, X decreases, and as a result of that Z increase (remember Z & X are inversely proportional) hence the CDP shifts to meet the prevailing market rates. Again, the algorithm taking care of itself.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h6>Customize Risk/Reward</h6>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nYou can customize your risk and reward. The protocol provides you with the functionality to customize your own risk for each transaction of lending or borrowing.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe risk gets reflected into reward i.e. Annual percentage rate (APR).\r\n<br /><br />\r\nFor lenders, low APR means higher insurance on their collateral. And vice-versa.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nFor borrowers, low APR means higher collateral amount locked. And vice-versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h6>Time Decay</h6>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn a constant product design like Timeswap’s, there is a risk of impermanent loss in the time decaying assets. Even though, markets have fixed maturity. It usually occurs when the prices of tokens in constant product AMM diverge. The greater the divergence, the greater the impermanent loss. Timeswap’s AMM, however, follows a linearly decreasing time decay.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAs a result, the impermanent loss occurred by the time variance to the liquidity providers, they use their Y or Interest Rate Pool parameter as time-invariant.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn the calculation of collateral to be locked by the borrower and the insurance value that can be claimed by a lender, the algorithm adjusts with time as d making Z or the collateral factor pool parameter as Time-Invariant.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<h5>Community</h5>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTimeswap has been following the community-first principle. Before launching on mainnet, they have built a sustaining, well-managed, and moderated community on Discord. They are growing strong with more than 28000 members.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe community managers are helpful and responsive. Even the members of the community come forward to help each other out. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe channels are curated in a way to help new members get every information about Timeswap at first glance. Regular AMAs hosted in the community with team members have been super helpful to understanding their vision and goal too.  They have a fairly active and large community on Twitter too, with more than 21 thousand members.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>Conclusion</h5>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTimeswap took a different approach to solve problems and their innovations are novel in the Defi ecosystem. Their vision with the promising team and community grows confidence in their innovation even further.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe oracle-less design enables them to become the first fully decentralized AMM-based money market protocol. With other market makers being multi-chain, their vision also seems to be aligning with the ecosystem.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn the future, their roadmap includes some exciting development on top of the current product. Ideally benefitting both the Defi ecosystem and the protocol. With the oracle-less technology, we could soon witness them being an on-chain source of truth for Defi. As per their whitepaper, there are some powerful use-cases in the future like reputation-based financing. They will allow reputation tokens like a Social token to be taken as collateral. The only obstacle right now is a good and fair mechanism to show reputation on-chain.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOverall the protocol aims to overcome the current shortcomings of the Defi ecosystem and promises to continue doing so in the future. It would be interesting to see how they come around solving inefficiencies in their protocol and what lies ahead in their journey.

Especially with projects such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and recently, Solana. If you hold any of these projects’ tokens, you know that over time they have provided excellent exponential gains. Such lucrative returns not only fuel the investments but also the investor’s greed which isn’t necessarily a wrong thing. Investing in these coins sounds like a no-brainer at the moment. But once you do that, and the next day there is a new project in town with more promising gains, how do you take advantage of it and maximize your gains while not missing out on the opportunity? \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou might want to sell the long-term bag of the coins you hold and invest it in the newer project to later come back to the former one. But this process exposes you to the market change within that time window and can cost you a lot of your gains. When the opportunity cost is so high on either side what can you do to prevent losing out on it?\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnter Hubble, a protocol built on the Solana blockchain to increase your liquidity up to 11x. What better than a stable coin to make new coin purchases. What it essentially does is, provide you with a loan for you to make new purchases against the coins you already have. But wait, wouldn’t the loan drown you in its interest percentage when you try to return it? Well, good news, Hubble only charges a 0.5% upfront fee and makes the whole lending process at a 0% interest rate making your next purchase easy and stress-free. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h5>What exactly is Hubble?</h5>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHubble is a smart contract protocol that exists within the Solana ecosystem. It is a multi-asset protocol that supercharges your liquidity (increasing it up to 110%!).\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe idea behind it is really simple yet so powerful and efficient. Hubble unlocks liquidity for the Solana ecosystem. Let’s understand it with an example:\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuppose you are an investor with a maintained portfolio of coins such as BTC, ETH, SOL. You want to purchase a new coin in town promising exponential returns in a matter of a few weeks.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat you can do is sell your current portfolio for stable coins such as USDC or USDT and convert them into new coins. You might even be tempted to do so, but is it feasible enough in this volatile market where the prices jump up and down by as much as 100% within a single day? No, right. Hubble solves this. You bring your assets to the protocol and deposit them as collateral. The protocol will use the collateral to provide you with its own stable coin USDH. You can claim as much as 11 times the collateral amount. You can then go ahead and buy the new coin using this USDH and when you get your returns from the promised platform, you can redeposit the loan amount at no extra cost and the profit will be all yours to keep.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBrilliant, right? You get to liquidate your assets without actually selling them. What more could you ask for? But wait, there’s more, you also get a yield on your deposited amount that you lock as collateral. They already have 4 yield protocols for Solana and 3 for Bitcoin using which they can choose the best platform for you to get the maximum possible yields daily and thereby optimizing your gains.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe protocol is ever-growing and the new tokens will be added to be accepted as collateral as the platform grows. The complete development of this protocol is still just Phase 1.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere will be Phase 2 dedicated to creating a treasury of the protocol’s native token HBB. So that it can be lent to the users for practices such as options strategy trading. Phase 3 will focus more on the collateralization problem and bridge the trust gap between the borrower and the lender.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInitially, Hubble will launch the borrowing protocol, later evolving into a more utility-\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h5>Why the Solana ecosystem?</h5>\r\nSolana is a user-friendly, scalable solution for all smart contracts and dApps. It is one of the most efficient chains in terms of speed, time, and fees. When you need the best yields for your collateral, you need a trustable and fast chain for smoother transactions. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSolana also has a good UX and is cheaper compared to other such platforms. Also, there is a lot of trust in this project. Now, for other chains, you’ll have to trade your SOL for USDC to invest in other strategies like futures, options as margin. But Hubble being present in the ecosystem helps in a way so that you won’t have to sell your SOL anymore and you can just borrow funds against it while staying on the platform itself.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h5>Key Features </h5>\r\nAs we saw earlier, Hubble protocols work in phases. Currently, phase 1 is going on. In which they aim to build infrastructure for borrowing and lending with a primary focus on borrowing. They are focusing on enabling users to unlock liquidity, increase capital efficiency and earn yield at the same time. As we already discussed, they do this with a bunch of exciting features like 0.5% fees, USDH stablecoin, multiple asset collateral, and zero-interest loans. We will dive into each of them, but first, let’s get the picture of borrowing on Hubble protocol:\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h5>\r\nBorrowing</h5>\r\n<br />\r\nRight now, Hubble is offering low-cost and capital-efficient borrowing. They allow a generous 110% collateral ratio for borrowing, whereas other protocols require 150% or more for borrowing. It also doesn’t charge interest rates and requires a payment due date, meaning you can repay the amount at any time. Unless you borrow more USDH.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHubble also enables a single user to become both lender and borrower, at the same time. While your collateral is ensuring the security of the user's loan, it’s earning yield and paying the debt also. Users can increase their deposited amount by choosing a yield strategy for their assets while they borrow. The debt remains the same. But as a self-repaying borrowing position, your collateral value increases. In the future, protocol looks to explore self-repaying loans too.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn top of all that, since protocol only charges the user once. Users can increase their leverage position without incurring the borrowing cost. So, to increase your leverage in the market, you deposit $1000 in ETH and take a loan. With that loan amount, you buy some more ETH and deposit them and rinse and repeat. That way, you can increase your collateral exposure and could gain up to 11x leverage.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom a protocol perspective, sitting idle with a blockchain asset is not the smartest strategy. So, Hubble partners with protocols across Solana to deploy collateral and earn yield for users.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAcross, phases 2 and 3, Hubble will introduce products like capital-protected notes by combining PoS yield and options combined with vanilla lending and undercollateralized bond issues.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet’s take a loan against your SOL in Hubble:\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe user has added 100 SOL as collateral and they can take out 3000 USDH. A fee of 0.5% is distributed among HBB holders and added to the debt.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h5>Multiple asset collateral</h5>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nOn Hubble, holders of six assets: SOL, ETH, BTC, FTT, RAY, and SRM, can lock their holdings. The protocol will issue USDH, which they can use to invest, spend or stake somewhere else to earn more yield.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince Hubble allows you to deposit multiple assets as collateral. It decreases users' liquidation risk because the volatility risk will be distributed among multiple assets. So, the decrease in the value of one of the assets won’t affect the liquidation of the user's assets. The basic don’t put your eggs in one basket situation.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHubble’s main value proposition is that it unlocks liquidity. How exactly? Let’s understand this with an example:\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuppose, you hold 2 ETH, 5 BTC & 200 SOL and you wish to hold them long-term and not sell any of them. But right now, there’s an exciting NFT project and you want to get involved in it. To solve that dilemma, you can deposit your assets as collateral, earn interest and get USDH stablecoin.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe maximum collateral that you can get on top of your assets is 110% of your asset value. Also called the collateral ratio, which is calculated by collateral value/loan value.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h5>HBB Token</h5>\r\n<br />\r\nHubble has their native value-accruing coin called HBB. Hubble distributes major revenue to the community, by allowing them to earn by staking their HBB token. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is a fee-sharing protocol. 85% of the revenue is distributed to users who stake their HBB. This revenue comes from the 0.5% fee for minting USDH and the 0.5% fee for redeeming USDH as collateral. Protocols look forward to exposing HBB stakers to additional revenue streams in the future.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h5>Governance and DAO</h5>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHBB is also a governance token for Hubble. Which allows users to vote on proposals and propose ideas for the protocol, with other governance activities. Once the protocol decentralizes and forms a DAO, the community will be in charge of the treasury. Right now, 15% of the revenue goes towards the protocol’s treasury.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nHubble’s roadmap includes implementing the governance in a completely decentralized format. Hubble started as a centralized entity and is moving slowly towards full decentralization, a situation where decision-making and protocol changes are handed over to the community. Right now, protocol suggests two types of proposal where the community will be able to vote on:\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n\r\nExecutable code proposals: Consisting of the majority of the proposals, implemented by the community and, upon successful voting, will be swapped out for the old programs.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<li>\r\n\r\nGeneral directive proposals: Once a quarter for part of developers’ time will be dedicated to community-driven decisions, subject to the previous quarter’s directive being completed.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nGovernance will follow typical community voting. Where HBB holders will have the power to vote initially. Then slowly it will be granted to USDH holders, Liquidity Pools for HBB or USDH providers, or open Debt Position holders.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h6>USDH</h6>\r\nHubble solved the huge problem of unlocking liquidity in the Solana ecosystem. USDH, which was 100% decentralized stablecoin on Solana, played an important role in that. It is backed, at least 150%, by a basket of assets such as SOL, BTC, ETH, and FTT. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo keep USDH pegged to the dollar, Hubble incentivizes arbitrageurs to keep it pegged with 1:1 value with USD. They allow face value redemption of USDH by trading on platforms like Saber. To be able to do this with Solana's speeds means that USDH should remain tightly pegged.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo understand this with examples, let’s say if USDH falls to 0.95 USD in market value, any user can purchase 95 USDH from the market and redeem that for $100 worth of any asset on Hubble. This burns USDH as it is received to quickly raise USDH’s value back to USD.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<h5>Community</h5>\r\n<br />\r\nHubble protocol has a very active Discord server. Devs keep updating and solving people’s queries on the server itself. Telegram and Twitter are pretty active too, with over 19 thousand followers on Twitter, providing users with regular updates about the protocol. The discord community itself is over 7000 members, growing significantly as we speak.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe regular interactions on these platforms are really helpful for growing the community and making more people aware of the protocol.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h5>Conclusion</h5>\r\n<br />\r\nIt is no doubt now that Hubble protocol is solving a huge problem here. Their vision and approach towards bringing liquidity to users seem promising for the Solana and Defi ecosystem.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLiquidity is every user’s pain point in interacting with Defi protocols. They need products that can solve these pain points and even benefit users upon using them. Hubble has so far been able to perfectly solve this. \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2022, the Solana Defi ecosystem will be a thing to watch out for. And it is of no doubt that the Hubble protocol is going to play a significant role in that. Super excited to see future product developments and innovations by Hubble!\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWritten with <a href='https://twitter.com/AaryanKataria' target='_blank'>Aaryan</a>\r\n</p>\r\n                <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p style={{color : \"rgba(204, 238, 253, 0.884)\"}}>Feb 2022</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default hubble;\r\n","C:\\Users\\neera\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Neerj\\src\\components\\all_blogs\\superficial.jsx",["252"],"import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction superficial() {\r\n    return(\r\n        <div className='container mx-auto text-start mt-5'>\r\n                        <nav aria-label=\"breadcrumb\">\r\n                <ol className=\"breadcrumb\">\r\n                    <li className=\"breadcrumb-item\"><Link to='/'>Home</Link></li>\r\n                    <li className=\"breadcrumb-item\" aria-current=\"page\"><Link to='/essays'>Essays</Link></li>\r\n                    <li className=\"breadcrumb-item active\" aria-current=\"page\">Superficiality & Substance</li>\r\n                </ol>\r\n            </nav>\r\n            <div className='content-div'>\r\n            \r\n                <h1 tabindex=\"0\" data-bs-toggle=\"popover\" data-bs-placement=\"right\" data-bs-trigger=\"hover focus\" data-bs-content=\"10 Mar 2022\" className='heading'>Superficiality & Substance</h1>\r\n            \r\n          \r\n            <p>\r\n                <br />\r\n                Humans are happier in anticipation than in acquiring. A person would be happier in the anticipation of getting rich, rather than actually getting rich. At least, the majority is. Also the reason why abundance is attracted by those who don’t bother in scarcity.\r\n                <br /><br/>\r\nAnticipation is necessarily what an animal lives for. The moment right before eating your favorite food is more rewarding than eating food. The dopamine spike is at its peak right before getting something you desire. It is our innate trait to desire things.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nIn the world of Instagram, where you already know what your long-term reward looks like for your effort, everything becomes hyper-superficial. Because we are talking about long-term rewards like relationships, career, friendships, and basically contentment. This is, I guess, a generalized view of success.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nIt is virtually fed to us without any effort as such. We are constantly bombarded with new narratives. To the point that now only a handful of people control their own life’s narrative at a young age.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nThat is because we have come to the point where we have to judge, make an opinion, reflect, get anxious, have FOMO, and feel hundreds of different things just by looking at a single frame of this person’s life whom you don’t even know. That gives you an identity FOMO. Which is that you want this particular part of their life into your own identity that you feel like you are missing out on, right now.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nEveryone is constantly making perceptions of you only with the limited knowledge they have. And you want that perception to be as good as it could possibly be.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nSo, you put your desired self online. A perfect self that you wish existed. Nothing wrong with that, if everyone is doing it. Since now our status is directly linked with our Instagram profile.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nYou put yourself exactly how you want the world to see you. Only so that by likes and a few comments you can assess your self-worth.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nAnd of course, I am not talking about you. I know you are just on Instagram for your friends. I get that. We are talking about other people.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nAll humans are insecure.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nThe most common insecurity is looks. Everyone was insecure about this at some point, at least. Now, we added another layer of insecurity on top of it with filters. It ‘enhances’ your image to make you look even more beautiful (seriously, stfu!).\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nThese filters make your insecurity invisible for a second. But now, it has made you more conscious of that insecurity. Which leads it to go deeper into your psyche. That’s good if it makes you realize that’s what it is and you’re amazing just the way you are (courtesy Bruno Mars). It turns bad when it leads to a downward spiral of realizing your hundred other insecurities. Which also have their solution in the hut of realization and acceptance.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nNow, I’m not here to give your just another identity crisis (or maybe I am?).\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nWe should talk about the other side of the coin, another side of superficiality i.e. substance. It is an uncommon word but it actually is what matters.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nAs the name suggests, the substance is the actual value. Your superpowers which you don't have to assert. Since individuals who actually have power, don't assert it. For example, an entrepreneur with no real product won’t shut up about her/his founding story.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nAgain, don't confuse asserting with selling yourself. Initially, you have to put yourself out there. Make yourself seen and make people realize your potential. After a point, real ones will automatically see through the real substance. \r\n<br /><br/>\r\nYour substance is what actually gets you somewhere in life. It makes you a player to play the game of life. When you go through the furnace of pain and hardships. You come out as a player on the other side.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nThen, game attracts game. You inevitably surround yourself with people who actually have some substance. Who is better than you, who can add value to your life, with whom you will become a better version of yourself, and with whom you can learn to live life.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nI was discussing with a friend about creating something valuable and I sent this message [img] to him, which he ended up saving in his notes, upon what comes before creating or building something in life that is actually meaningful and you actually want to create. Where you are not living in the fantasy of being an artist or entrepreneur, but you genuinely want to do it with your heart. When you don’t care about anything else. When you no longer need to learn “How to get into flow state—”.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nYou will know when you genuinely want to do something when you stop asking all the “How to—” and make your craft. \r\n<br /><br/>\r\nYou will know.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\n<img style={{width: '90%'}} src='https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae9a5b4-9234-461e-91bc-d37beaccfd42_1464x304.jpeg'></img>\r\n     </p>           \r\n<br />\r\n<br/>\r\n            <p style={{color : \"rgba(204, 238, 253, 0.884)\"}}>March 2022</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n \r\nexport default superficial;\r\n","C:\\Users\\neera\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Neerj\\src\\components\\all_blogs\\love.jsx",["253","254"],"import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction love() {\r\n    return(\r\n        <div className='container mx-auto text-start mt-5'>\r\n                        <nav aria-label=\"breadcrumb\">\r\n                <ol className=\"breadcrumb\">\r\n                    <li className=\"breadcrumb-item\"><Link to='/'>Home</Link></li>\r\n                    <li className=\"breadcrumb-item\" aria-current=\"page\"><Link to='/essays'>Essays</Link></li>\r\n                    <li className=\"breadcrumb-item active\" aria-current=\"page\">love</li>\r\n                </ol>\r\n            </nav>\r\n            <div className='content-div'>\r\n            \r\n                <h1 tabindex=\"0\" data-bs-toggle=\"popover\" data-bs-placement=\"right\" data-bs-trigger=\"hover focus\" data-bs-content=\"14 Feb 2022\" className='heading'>love</h1>\r\n            \r\n          \r\n            <p><br />\r\n        <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\r\n                <img style={{height: '500px'}} src='https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90d36413-ac1a-4122-8ecf-701595a92740_750x1334.jpeg' />\r\n            </div><br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            This tree is right outside my house. I have more pictures of this tree than my own, as you will see down below. I certainly feel almost everything only after looking at this tree for a while. My mom thinks I am mad sometimes when I spend a lot of time just staring at it. One of the latest things that made me feel after looking at this tree was love. Not romance or all that Hollywood jazz, but just a feeling of love. The one where you feel one with something. It could be nature, a book, a song, your morning coffee, a tree, or anything. And well, sometimes, it’s another human being too. \r\n<br /><br/>\r\nI wonder, wasn’t that the purpose of humans in the first place. I am damn sure, God gave humans a pinch of consciousness just to experience love. But everyone just became too caught up in feeling loved, that they forget to love. Everyone wants to feel loved, but nobody wants to love. They are afraid.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nRomanticize your present life, people will walk towards you like a magnet. Tell me what would you do, if you have no insecurities and you were assured that you are taken care of your basic needs. Your answer would be some version of contentment and love.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nThere have to be different aspects to life too like work, rest, and self-love. Last one is most important in order to love others. And the first two ensure that.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nI may be describing a utopia. But at the end of the day, we all are chasing our own versions of utopias, right. Dystopia is also just an attempt to create a different version of utopia as you know it.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nSomeone, I think Sadhguru, said “People want a dog or they want God. Either way, they just want unconditional love.” I believe that if you have Indian grandparents, you roughly know what unconditional love feels like.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nDon’t take my word for any of it. Since I have not fallen in love as per Instagram. Albeit, we are a generation of people longing for relationships that can be reeled on social media. Somebody recently told me that “I appreciate your intellectual courage to put out ideas” when I was going through an impostor episode for my writing. Hence, my reluctance to put out this piece pretty much vanished.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nAmy Winehouse describes my relationship with love in my life perfectly:\r\n<br />\r\nI’m a very romantic person. I don’t mean romantic in flowers and chocolate kind of way. It’s more life if it’s raining, I’ll go upto the window and press my nose against the glass and sigh at how beautiful it all looks.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nI also think love is just another word for feeling heard. Yeah, when you listen to someone with all your mind and heart, they will feel love. People want to be heard. While everyone is going about their day, their hardships, difficulties, and whatnot. Everybody got a thing to say. But very few people got that to listen. You necessarily don’t need anything out of the world to say, but if you just listen intently you will win most people in the world.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nAnother problem is that most people are in a fairytale. That there is someone out there a “soulmate”, ugh. Tim Urban in one of his Wait But Why blog gives a practical point on “the one”:\r\n<br/>\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nSay two people want to find the love of their life, Person A and Person B.\r\n<br />\r\nPerson A never goes on dates, opting instead to sit alone debating in her head about who the exact kind of person is she will fall in love with. She scours online profiles, but never contacts anyone. Instead, her plan is to wait until she comes across the profile so perfect for her that she’ll know she’s found The One. Then and only then will she reach out to that person for a date.\r\n<br />\r\nPerson B goes on a lot of dates, constantly meeting new people and keeping an open mind, because she knows she probably doesn’t know either herself or the type of match that makes sense for her as well as she thinks she does.\r\n<br />\r\nWho’s more likely to find the love of their life?\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nLove, live, and let live.\r\n<br/>\r\nCiao.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\n<div>\r\n    <img style={{width: '100%', height: '350px'}} src='https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_5760,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa303e1d5-a84f-4dab-80ad-de5d1dd1edf1_5639x1334.png' />\r\n</div>\r\n</p>            \r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br/>\r\n            <p style={{color : \"rgba(204, 238, 253, 0.884)\"}}>Feb 2022</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      \r\n    )\r\n}\r\n \r\nexport default love;\r\n","C:\\Users\\neera\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Neerj\\src\\components\\all_blogs\\language.jsx",[],"C:\\Users\\neera\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Neerj\\src\\components\\all_blogs\\great.jsx",["255"],"import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction great(){\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className='container mx-auto text-start mt-5'>\r\n            <nav aria-label=\"breadcrumb\">\r\n                <ol className=\"breadcrumb\">\r\n                    <li className=\"breadcrumb-item\"><Link to='/'>Home</Link></li>\r\n                    <li className=\"breadcrumb-item\" aria-current=\"page\"><Link to='/essays'>Essays</Link></li>\r\n                    <li className=\"breadcrumb-item active\" aria-current=\"page\">Being great: creativity & mathematics</li>\r\n                </ol>\r\n            </nav>\r\n            <div className='content-div'>\r\n                <span className=\"d-inline-block\" tabindex=\"0\" data-bs-toggle=\"popover\" data-bs-placement=\"right\"data-bs-trigger=\"hover focus\" data-bs-content=\"30 Apr 2022\">\r\n                    <h1 className='heading strong bold'>Being great: creativity & mathematics</h1>\r\n                </span>\r\n                <p>\r\n                I have not skipped any monthly essays in the last 20 months. It was not looking to go up to 21. Simply because I did not have any good idea after posting the last essay. But as I was writing on 29th April, just one day before breaking the streak, I had three options.\r\n                <br /><br/>\r\nFirst, break the streak. Second, post some old unfinished poorly edited essay. Third and the most interesting one, leave study for the exam that I have in just 7 days to sit down to write something worthy. Well, you know what I chose.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, I did not post for a while because creativity did not hit me during that period. I wrote some rookie short fiction at that time. But no essays. Ironically, I had more experiences during this period than in the last 2 years combined. Maybe that was the reason in the first place.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nThis is a common struggle with people who are in a creative pursuit, unlike me. At least the ones I have talked to do. Creativity strikes whenever and you need to acknowledge it. It’s random. So, do people with creative pursuits keep doing nothing until creativity strikes them. Should they not have a routine and structure since their way to achieve their goal is so random.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nBefore we discuss that further, ask yourself have you ever thought of being one of the greats? In whatever way it makes sense to you. Let me tell you, I have. It might sound ridiculous to the average person. But that’s one of the ongoing queries in my life for — as far as I can remember.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nOn surface level, there are only two pursuits to being one of the greats i.e. creative way and logical way. Usually referred to as, left brain and right brain. Don’t quote me on this but my guess would be that the tasks that come naturally to you and need the least effort to get into a flow state is your dominant brain. If you are a creative person, running a business with be painful for you. Because your decisions will be clouded by emotions rather than reasoning. And if you are a logical person, crashing a Boeing 747 into building and blowing it up for a scene will sound bonkers to you. 1\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nYour self-awareness and self-knowledge play an important role too. Because how are you going to be on top of the game if you do not even know the game. You have to know your strengths and weaknesses after years of trial and error. Which is famously known as passion. It does not come by scrolling Twitter and watching YouTube videos.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nSince this is not Twitter, let’s talk about the nuance in this situation. You might think that a major inclination toward one part of the brain is the path to being great. Either let my emotions create some art or use reason and logic to seek the truth, right. But this could also lead to a disaster. You must have seen a person taking all decisions in life based on his emotions. He does not have control of his life. He cannot reason with himself to distinguish between what is good or bad. He is sleepwalking through his own life.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nOn other hand, person who is extremely driven by reasoning does not taste life. His eyes usually seem so dead. In order to find truth and logic in every single thing, he forgets to appreciate the beauty of it as it is. While interacting with other people, he cannot listen to what they feel. Rather he listens to what they think. Emotions are non-existent for him. A good example can be Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nApparently, even being great requires balance.\r\n<br /><br/>\r\nAs Tyler Hogge concludes in his <a href='https://tylerhogge.com/2015/10/07/whiplash-and-greatness/' target=\"_blank\">blog</a> \"Always happy; never satisfied\", often being one of the greats is a deliberate and conscious decision. They tend to accept the sacrifices that come with that decision after recognizing their own strength and weaknesses. And anyone can be one of the greats!\r\n</p>           \r\n<br />\r\n<br/>\r\n            <p style={{color : \"rgba(204, 238, 253, 0.884)\"}}>April 2022</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n \r\nexport default great;","C:\\Users\\neera\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Neerj\\src\\components\\all_blogs\\melancholic.jsx",[],"C:\\Users\\neera\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Neerj\\src\\components\\all_blogs\\fiction\\biconomy.jsx",["256"],"import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction biconomy(){\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className='container mx-auto text-start mt-5'>\r\n            <nav aria-label=\"breadcrumb\">\r\n                <ol className=\"breadcrumb\">\r\n                    <li className=\"breadcrumb-item\"><Link to='/'>Home</Link></li>\r\n                    <li className=\"breadcrumb-item\" aria-current=\"page\"><Link to='/essays'>Essays</Link></li>\r\n                    <li className=\"breadcrumb-item active\" aria-current=\"page\">Biconomy</li>\r\n                </ol>\r\n            </nav>\r\n            <div className='content-div'>\r\n                <span className=\"d-inline-block\" tabindex=\"0\" data-bs-toggle=\"popover\" data-bs-placement=\"right\"data-bs-trigger=\"hover focus\" data-bs-content=\"10 Jan 2022\">\r\n                    <h1 className='heading strong bold'>Deep Dive: Biconomy</h1>\r\n                </span>\r\n                <p>\r\n                If you are new to the world of web3.0, I recommend you to go through <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SWJw_NTyUvgdB_asRzsnVyKjciW8dZbeqQeUeWsEiQc/edit'>this document</a>, which goes on to explain each of the blockchain concepts in short blurbs with providing resources to deep dive further into them.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWe will start with the background of the founders and team. How they jumped from crypto in China in 2016-17 to coming back to build in India. We will go through why there is even a need for Biconomy, the impact of the problem they are solving, how they are solving it, what are the products of Biconomy, their amazing community, and their tokenomics with $BICO token. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nBefore we jump into all of it, let’s understand a few terms:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>dApp</strong>: This is a short form of decentralized application, is software that runs on a distributed network. This means, it’s not on a centralized server (ex. AWS, Google Cloud) but a peer-to-peer decentralized network (ex. Ethereum). \r\n\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>SDK</strong>: Again, short form of the software development kit. It is a set of tools and programs to be used by developers to create applications on/for specific platforms.\r\n\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Blockchain bridges</strong>: “Currency exchange service but between blockchains” It allows blockchains to communicate with each other. Hence, enable you to move your assets or data across different blockchain networks. \r\n\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>Background</h5>\r\n\r\nCOO & Co-founder of Biconomy Aniket, got into crypto in 2016-17 in China. In Chinese, the word bi means token. Hence, the word Biconomy. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nAfter working with Binance alongside CZ, he came back to India with a vision to work in blockchain in India. He met one of his co-founders & CTO Sachin at a crypto conference. Sachin has just left his job at Samsung to go all-in into crypto. He was friends with Ahmed, another co-founder, and CEO of Biconomy, who also just came back from Dubai to work on blockchain.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThey started Biconomy as a side project for some time. In May 2019, they started working on it full-time.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nFor the first year, the team bootstrapped with personal capital and few grants to build products and find product-market fit. In May 2020 they did a soft launch of Biconomy.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThey knew this was a hard problem to solve at the moment in the blockchain space.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>Introduction</h5>\r\n\r\nWith the significant adoption of web3.0, Ethereum blockchain has been congested, so to say. Activity is outperforming the efficiency of the chain. On top of that, Web3.0 space is craving for someone to come up and solve the problems of user experience (UX) and gas fees. These are, most probably, the two biggest pain points at the moment to make blockchain mainstream. Apple made computers mainstream by reducing the need for technical manuals to operate computers. They made the design, with hardware, super intuitive for an average person. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nNow everybody can operate the most complex machines without any help. We need the intuitiveness of web2.0 products in web3.0. That’s where Biconomy enters the game:\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBiconomy is making smart relayer infrastructure for blockchain transactions that reduce the friction between applications built on blockchain and users. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThey accomplish this with a set of SDKs and APIs that work together to simplify the dApp development for the developers. Biconomy abstracts the complexity of blockchain and dApps for an average user with the help of their wonderful technology.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBiconomy observed some of the biggest bottlenecks and set out to solve them for the ecosystem. The first one was, of course, the gas fees. Imagine paying a fee every time you post a tweet on Twitter or watch a YouTube video. It's a real pain right now.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe second one was mandatory spending ETH to interact with dApps. Most widely-used, trusted applications are run on the Ethereum blockchain. Users may not want to spend their ETH. There could be many reasons that users may not want to spend their ETH holdings while interacting with dApps. Holding a particular token should not prevent users from leveraging blockchain products.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe third one was onboarding. For non-crypto folks, the number of steps to finally be able to use blockchain products is way too much friction. In the world of ~5% drop-off rate per second, these painful steps were not looking good in making blockchain products mainstream.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAlso, as more and more dApps move to chains other than Ethereum, multi-chain dApp users need infrastructure to navigate the protocols. We are already seeing a bunch of bridge solutions that help move information and funds between various chains.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOn top of all these problems, high volumes of transactions on chains get stuck, pending, or often failed. That happens because if there is a problem with one transaction on-chain then the next transaction cannot take place. For example, if 3 transactions are taking place on a chain, the 3rd and 2nd transactions won’t take place unless and until the 1st one is resolved i.e. cleared or failed. It is a crucial problem to solve.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nCreating solutions for all these problems in-house is a resource, time, and effort heavy for any team. Even though there are projects like Argent, Nuo, and Monolith who are working with the in-house solution for all these problems. Biconomy proposes to save months of development time with a simple SDK so that developers can focus on building their core products.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nEnough for the problems, let’s understand how Biconomy is paving the way for both developers and end-users to bring blockchain into the industry:\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBiconomy wants to solve blockchain complexities under the hood in order to make the experience frictionless for developers and users. They achieve this by a concept called meta transactions.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>Meta-transaction</h5>\r\n\r\nIt enables users to use blockchain without a wallet or cryptocurrencies from an exchange. By removing the need to pay gas fees for the user!\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBelieve it or not, it’s true. It works in a way where the user is able to perform transactions on blockchain with 0 balance in wallet or dApp. Layer1 wouldn’t be very happy with that, right. So, any third party pays the transaction fees for the user. You can think of it as a customer acquisition cost (CAC) that is paid by the developers to onboard the user into their dApp.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOn top of that, there are several benefits of using meta-transaction technology. Starting with transaction management. Because managing transactions is a huge bottleneck for developers to focus on core products in Defi. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn easy language, the reason behind it is that when the number of transactions in the verifying queue exceeds the capacity of new blocks, the network suffers. Because transactions with lower gas fees get lost and stuck in the verification queue a.k.a mempool. As a result, the developer suffers. Meta transaction provides the infrastructure to solve this problem in the quickest time possible with relayer.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn the near future, meta transactions would reduce on-chain load with the help of batching process. Multiple queries from a dApp can be processed as one on-chain transaction. In order to decrease the response time and gas fees.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nEven though Ethereum blockchain is the largest blockchain in terms of dApps. Its volatility in fee per transaction makes it less reliable for adoption. As industry leaders would prefer to choose a network with a fixed fee to maintain their budget and finances. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nBusinesses who aim to use blockchain will most probably go with private blockchain because of their constant fee structure. But the private blockchains are not as secure as public ones. Meta transactions on the public blockchain will allow businesses to provide subscription-based services for the ecosystem through fiat/stable coins.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThere are lots and lots of use cases that meta-transactions unlock for the whole ecosystem. For example, an ad model where a company like Chipotle can become a sponsor of user gas fees. (Ah, advertisements will never leave you, no). Opportunities are, quite literally, endless.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>Cross-chain transaction</h5>\r\n\r\nAs the name suggests, refers to the transfer of assets between different blockchain networks.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nEvery blockchain works independently from the other. Solana is not compatible with Ethereum and vice-versa. To perform transactions between these blockchains we have bridges. Cross-chain bridges empower users and projects by unifying these ecosystems.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhether or not you believe in the (inevitable) multi-chain future, you’d agree that being able to transfer assets between chains would greatly increase the value of assets. As it will increase their use-cases and provide more yield. Most Defi protocols today are multi-chain because they understand this.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhile most protocols don’t plan to leave the base layer of Ethereum completely, various protocols have applied various scaling solutions. Mostly Layer2 solutions. But as we move to various scaling solutions, they bring new problems. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nCurrently, all solutions have their own fragmented ecosystems. Interacting between L1 and various L2s, sidechains, etc. is slow, expensive, and complicated. Because of friction between these solutions and users, each layer2 solution will start acting as its own close economy. Hence, reducing the potential benefits and network effect for the ecosystem.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMoving the whole ecosystem to one of the L2 scaling solutions is not sensible. The same problems will follow as the L1 solution. Right now, you can only interact with the L2 solution you are part of. Because transfer between different L2 solutions is not efficient. The solution to solve this becomes existing as a separate community with weak network effects. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nAs a result, more and more scaling solutions will be present in the ecosystem and they all will co-exist. Each of them will cater to its specific use case. Hence, ensuring scalability.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nNow, if the co-existence of multiple scaling solutions across networks is inevitable. Then we need an infrastructure to connect these fragmented solutions for the end-user. Biconomy enables the flow of assets & information across different chains in an easy, affordable, secure, and decentralized way. Building a foundation for a seamless multi-chain infrastructure for web3.0.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe meta-transactions, cross-chain transfers, and communication are possible by Biconomy’s decentralized multi-chain relayer network. A distributed set of node operators on every supported chain will power the Biconomy network. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nAs a result of that, Biconomy has been able to launch some of the most revolutionizing products in the blockchain infrastructure space. As of this writing, there are three primary products under the umbrella of Biconomy:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>MEXA</h5>\r\n\r\nMexa or Magical Experiences Anywhere, Anytime.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIt is also known as Gasless. As the name suggests, it enables gasless transactions for end users. With the help of meta transactions, Mexa offers an SDK to developers to build seamless user experiences for their dApp. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nBiconomy requires developers to connect their smart contracts to their dashboard. Afterward, these are some of the ways they can integrate Mexa into the dApp:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\nTo enable native meta transactions in your contract, you can just inherit a simple contract BaseRelayRecipient.sol and set the trusted forwarder address.\r\n\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\nFor the custom meta transaction implementation, you have to register your smart contract with Biconomy.\r\n\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\nBiconomy also allows developers to register external wallet contracts on the Dashboard. Developers can use Biconomy as a relayer service to relay their transactions without failing. \r\n\r\n    </li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nFor Mexa, they have some promising features in the roadmap. New chain integrations like Solana, Fantom, and Abritrum. Also, more decentralization and wallet address whitelisting for dApp partners.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>Forward</h5>\r\n\r\nForward enables users to cover their gas fees in ERC20 tokens other than ETH. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nWith a focus on payments and Defi, Forward is designed to work on any dApp on Ethereum. At the moment, Forward supports payment using stable coins such as Dai, USDC & USDT. With more tokens support in the pipeline. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nForward unlocks huge opportunities for developers to experiment and build different use cases with their products. Defi protocols no more have to bind their users to hold ETH in order to interact with their product. Many applications can encourage new users with their tokens. Play-to-earn and other blockchain games can allow players to play games by paying fees in their own tokens. Forward unlocks endless opportunities for the whole ecosystem.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nForward enables dApps to improve on their UX for the end-users in majorly two ways:\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAllowing end-users to save their ETH with their relayers, by allowing them to pay in other tokens.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nNo transactions getting stuck for dApps.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOf course, Gasless != Free. It is evident that a Layer 1 dApp cannot cover the gas fees for its users. Gas fees on Ethereum are just painfully high. Meta transactions eliminate a pain point in Defi use cases that already involve tokens in some way. Also, 90% of the time these transactions or transfers are more than $1000 in value.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>Hyphen</h5>\r\n\r\nHyphen provides simple APIs that let you offer instant transactions between various L2 solutions, EVM chains, and other sidechains. It acts as a bridge between these chains to enable transactions cheaply, securely, and quickly. Currently, transfer from Layer2 native bridges to Layer1 sometimes takes 40minutes to 7 days! \r\n<br /><br />\r\nWe discussed in the cross-chain transaction section about the importance of a product such as Hyphen for the web3.0 future. This is the infrastructure that will be bridging the gap between different fragmented L2 solutions with high compatibility and interoperability.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAs we tend towards a multi-chain future, cheap, secure, and scalable inter-chain transfers will play an important role. Biconomy aims to decentralize the infrastructure across all the supported networks. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nAs they work towards decentralizing the product, anyone will be able to provide liquidity, act as a node, and contribute to the protocol, as per their roadmap. In return, LPs, node operators, and other stakeholders will earn a percentage network revenue. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThey launched with USDC & USDT and supporting chains are Ethereum & Polygon. There are going to be new chain integrations for Hyphen. In the roadmap, they have BSC, Moonbeam, Arbitrum, and Optimism. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nAnother promising feature in Biconomy’s Q1 roadmap is that anyone will be able to add liquidity to Hyphen Liquidity Pools and earn LP fees.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>Tokenomics</h5>\r\n\r\nBiconomy has recently released its $BICO token. It is a native governance token. It will surely play an important role in decentralizing the network by incentivizing all the stakeholders to secure and maintain the network.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe Biconomy blockchain acts as a verification layer for activities on the Biconomy network across all the chains. Node operators on the chain pay a fee of $BICO to add any info to the chain and proportionally earn $BICO.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThere are other incentives for validators and executors: \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThey can stake their $BICO to start their contribution to the network. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThey can also stake their $BICO to secure the network. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nLiquidity providers can provide the protocol active liquidity in different tokens across different chains. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn all of these contributions, users will earn a proportionate amount of rewards, mostly in $BICO.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOther than contributions by the community, governance will allow $BICO holders to propose and vote upon protocol decisions.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThere are in total of 1 Billion BICO tokens and here’s how the distribution is going to look like:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nAs of now, you can’t buy $BICO. The token generation event (TGE) happened on 23rd November 2021. \r\n<br /><br />\r\n<h5>Community</h5>\r\n\r\nAs a company, their values are reflected in their products. Making blockchain technology accessible to everyone with simplicity.\r\n<br />\r\n            <br />\r\nThey started with building one product but after feedback and suggestions from the community, they have three products today. From the initial days, Biconomy has shown good consideration to feedback from the community. The community has reciprocated that too.\r\n<br />\r\n            <br />\r\nThey have a strong community of over 100,000 members (107,600, as of this writing) on Discord. With over 63,000 followers on Twitter. That shows the impact of the product, collaborations, and engagement across all platforms.\r\n<br />\r\n            <br />\r\nBiconomy’s initiatives for the community are inspirational for other protocols. They have community participation contests such as the content of the week, where they reward community members with $BICO for their work. Several other initiatives by Biconomy like bug bounties, biconaut ambassador program, token community calls, etc. \r\n<br />\r\n            <br />\r\nAfter governance, they have been more involving the community members further. Participating in proposals, community discussions, and their recently launched forum. \r\n<br />\r\n            <br />\r\nGovernance process is also transparent and simple. The biconomy team initiates forum topics and discussions. After sufficient interest from the community, they will create a proposal to formalize the discussion. Community governance calls will take place to discuss the proposals. Then the team will move the proposal to Snapshot for voting. If it is passed, then the Biconomy team will execute the decision.\r\n<br />\r\n            <br />\r\n<h5>Conclusion</h5>\r\n\r\nBiconomy has been in the industry before the Defi summer of 2020, they knew from the first day that this is a very important and albeit hard problem to solve. They are now a common integration for the development of any new app. \r\n<br />\r\n            <br />\r\nThe company which builds the infrastructure that makes it easy for other players to enter the industry inevitably wins in the long term.  Stripe and AWS are examples of successes of such products in web2.0. Patrick Collison has this analogy for Stripe that “Stripe is building roads while tech companies are building cars.” The same applies to Biconomy.\r\n<br />\r\n            <br />\r\nSimilarly, Biconomy is going to be a giant player in the industry. With their ethos of decentralization, it would be exhilarating to see how they go about building products and the community around them. In the 2022 roadmap, Biconomy aims to make Gasless and Hyphen more decentralized with a mainnet launch on Relayer protocol, a growing network of node operators, delegators & liquidity providers, supporting more chains and governance.\r\n<br />\r\n            <br />\r\nThey are still in the early days of revolutionizing the blockchain experience for the end-users. But it is of no doubt, right now, that they are solving a huge pain point for everyone in the ecosystem. Hence, their success is inevitable. As Ahmed, co-founder of Biconomy, himself puts it:\r\n<br />\r\n            <br />\r\nIn Web2, payments and transfers happen within the app with minimal clicks. For Web3 to reach mass adoption, cross-chain transfers must be in-dApp as well. This year will be the year of frictionless Web3 experiences that finally make it mainstream.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSuper excited to see Biconomy making dApps accessible to everyone with their under the hood products!\r\n            </p>\r\n                <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p style={{color : \"rgba(204, 238, 253, 0.884)\"}}>Jan 2022</p>\r\n
