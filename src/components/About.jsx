            <p>I am Neeraj.</p>
            <p>A nomad genz, currently based out of India.</p>
            <p>It has been quite difficult for me to list down my interests.</p>
            <p>But some of the fields that I have been interested from quite a long time are tech, art, psychology and writing. In the same order of magnitude.</p>
            <p>In the near future, I will be studying one of the above mentioned fields abroad.</p>
            <p>Running few things on the internet, more about them <Link to='/work'>here</Link>.</p>
            <p>p.s. feel free to reach out, if you are working on some cool stuff, need help with anything or just intellectually curious. Here's my <Link to='/random'>contact</Link></p>
