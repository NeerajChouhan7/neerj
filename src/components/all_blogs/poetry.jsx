                I wish I was dead and cold,
seeking validation from my demons
tried, but could no more hold
going down spiral my head uphold
Then, maybe I could have embraced
sleepless nights in my bed,
love and hate, only in my head,
uninterested talks with my friend.
All went down in drain,
when I lost to myself
and my pain

                Can't take back the love that I gave you,

Surely, it was me, not you.

Staring in the abyss,

not to find myself but you

Came back from darkness,

hoping for ecstacy to come and find me.

Letting go could be an act of kindness,

maybe for you, but not for me. 

After, essence of life was lost,

thought, I could find that myself.

Turns out, essence was you

                Let me try,

don't stop, bind or catch me

let me fly.

Without any awareness, only ignorance

you are binding me in invisible chain.

Dare you do that to my playfulness,

hoping for life to come and find me in my pain.

Not leap of ignorance but of faith.

Trust me, and I will try,

not to disappoint you or make you cry

But at least let me try
