                I wish I was dead and cold,<br/>
seeking validation from my demons<br/>
tried, but could no more hold<br/>
going down spiral my head uphold<br/><br/>
Then, maybe I could have embraced<br/>
sleepless nights in my bed,<br/>
love and hate, only in my head,<br/>
uninterested talks with my friend.<br/><br/>
All went down in drain,<br/>
when I lost to myself<br/>
and my pain<br/>
</p>
<br/>
                <br/>
                <h6>2.</h6>
                
                <p>
                Can't take back the love that I gave you,
                <br/>
Surely, it was me, not you.
<br/>
Staring in the abyss,
<br/>
not to find myself but you
<br/><br/>
Came back from darkness,
<br/>
hoping for ecstacy to come and find me.
<br/>
Letting go could be an act of kindness,<br/>

maybe for you, but not for me. <br/>
<br/>
After, essence of life was lost,<br/>

thought, I could find that myself.<br/>

Turns out, essence was you<br/>
</p>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h6>3.</h6>
                <p>
                Let me try,
                <br/>
don't stop, bind or catch me
<br/>
let me fly.<br/>
<br/>
Without any awareness, only ignorance
<br/>
you are binding me in invisible chain.
<br/>
Dare you do that to my playfulness,
<br/>
hoping for life to come and find me in my pain.
<br/><br/>
Not leap of ignorance but of faith.
<br/>
Trust me, and I will try,
<br/>
not to disappoint you or make you cry
<br/>
But at least let me try
</p>
<br/>
                <br/>
                <h6>4.</h6>
                
                <p>
                So for now, let's all enjoy this view,
<br/>
persevering in the hardship,
<br/>
pausing not to reflect of thy but on you,
<br/>
treating your time not as worship

                </p>
                
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h6>5.</h6>
                <p>
                That corner of my mind, just to hide,
                <br/>
where my all fears reside.
<br/>
Trying to look them in the eyes,<br/>

hiding from emotions in the tide.<br/>
<br/>
You will have to look,<br/>

you can't hide for your life<br/>

spine straight, shoulders unhook,<br/>

if you won't, it will left you shook.<br/><br/>
meet eye to eye to your fear<br/>
talk to it to know it,
<br/>

understand it,
<br/>

kill it
                </p>
                <br/>
                <br/>

                <p>
                Applaud my friends,
                <br/>
the comedy is over.
<br/>
End of my destined path,
<br/>
the tragedy is over.
<br/>
<br/>
Start laughing and stop crying, 
<br/>
it was a circus, but we all were joker.
<br/>
With constant suffering and trying,
<br/>
remorse behind the laugh, residing.
<br/>
<br/>
Remorse for seeking validation,
<br/>
not being with loved one, not following your passion.</p><br/>
                <br/>
                <h6>7.</h6>
                <p>
                Gusse se bhara hai ye ateet mera, chahu magar bhul na pau.
                <br/>
kehta hai wo utaar de kaagaz pe saara,
<br/>
wo kya jaane, chahta me bhi hu par himmat na juta pau.
<br/>
<br/>
Khuda ko bol aake puch le mere se meri raza kya hai.
<br/>
Shayad me jawab dene ki takleef me khud bhi jaan jau.
<br/>
Khade to me or khuda the waha,
<br/>
par baat dono ka ahankaar raha hai.</p><br/>
                <br/>
                <h6>8.</h6>
                <p>
                To not let go of the grudges that I hold to this day,
                <br/>
But to the happy memories that I could never let go of. 
<br/><br/>
To make living hell on earth, just tell me, the one
<br/>
Suffering are my friends, I'm not there.
<br/>
To help them, console them or die with them,
<br/>
inserting bad moments, in the loopholes of happy ones.</p><br/>
                <br/>
                <h6>9.</h6>
                <p>
                Most pretends to be friends, others got some already.
                <br/>
You, my friend, become your own.
<br/>
Path is lonelier than you imagined,
<br/>
waiting for that one, to make me forget other eleven.
<br/><br/>
But don't worry it's not test for you,
<br/>
but for those who stays.
<br/>
Look over your shoulder in hardship,
<br/>
who is standing their, has pass the test.
<br/>
If no one has, give it time, be patient.
                    </p><br/>

                <h6>10.</h6>
                <p>
                Our eyes met.
                <br/>
Everyday my eyes used to go to meet her.
<br/>
But i didn't, yet.
<br/><br/>
Only for a single glance,
<br/>
I ride, to let fate take the chance.
<br/>
Everyday there was only one moment,
<br/>
but it made whole life, a better dance.
<br/><br/>
She smiled rarely with her eyes, 
<br/>
but her lips were suffice.
<br/>
They told me everything,
<br/>
she was afraid to compromise.
<br/><br/>
Eyes, chico, they never lie,
<br/>
how could they when heart bona fide.
<br/>
her hairs, in my finger, tie.
<br/>
to her eyes i still cannot lie.
                    </p><br/>
                <br/>
                <h6>11.</h6>
                <p>
                Would you never know that that was it? 
                <br/>
wandering around finding your why
<br/>
just to realize that you lost the shit
<br/>
was that you or them, but you both lost it.
<br/><br/>
Will you stop questioning they would be as sad as you.
<br/>
would they be thinking about you, as much as you,
<br/>
will you need them, as you need you,
<br/>
guess you never know, or would you?
<br/><br/>
Wish someone told me, us, that was the last one,
<br/>
to make it as cheerful as one could make,
<br/>
no matter how long it take,
<br/>
we would have felt like it took one.
<br/><br/>
At the end, pondering over what it's worth anyway,
<br/>
you've gone too far to make it work,
<br/><br/>
memories are being too stubborn to let go,
<br/>
nights are sleepless to talk anyone not to,
<br/>
would you have let me go,
<br/>
if you had anyone else to talk to.
<br/><br/>
wearing your woolen sweater,
<br/>
you said it looked better, did you.
<br/>
sore eyes, brighter than the blue sky 
<br/><br/>
we could have build a castle,
<br/>
of our dreams, 
<br/>
make sure not of sand to avoid drizzle,
<br/>
as a team.</p><br/>
                <br/>
                <h6>12.</h6>
                <p>
                with moving towards death,
                <br/>
at each point of short but big life,
<br/>
we notice seasons differently. 
<br/><br/>
Some emotions get attached to those seasons,
<br/>
some seasons get attached to our hearts. 
<br/>
With body adapting to those seasons,
<br/>
our heart finds it difficult to do so. Sometimes it doesn't.
<br/><br/>
walking, talking, behavior, everything seems seperated by seasons.
                </p>

                <p>
                I'm lying to myself that I can see,
                <br/>
to file myself and make a plea
<br/>
I will plead guilty
<br/>
but with setting me free.
<br/><br/>
With the lie of watching myself,
<br/>
i wandered every corner of my city.
<br/>
to, as they say, know thyself.
<br/>
came back with scar on my face by followers of a deity
<br/><br/>
Did they knew themselves? I wondered
<br/>
Well, i can believe that and i did.
<br/>
In thunder, that's only thing they remembered.
<br/>
not caring about how many were murdered.
<br/><br/>
Again went back wandering around streets,
<br/>
knowing destination was at my place.
<br/>
I still wandered leaving every trace,,
<br/>
no one knew my face,
<br/>
I was a mess.
<br/><br/>
Maybe it was the fog or lights blinding
<br/>
with a torch but battery abiding.
<br/>
stepped into fogged faking courage
<br/>
just to face my face and a stone colliding.

                Cant get it out of my head,
                <br/>
because it was a vibe not experience.
<br/>
and aspirations of the vibe
<br/>
your vibe, the vibe you enjoy

and cant get it outta your head

                I want to break free,
                <br/>
they couldnt let me.
<br/>
crabs pulling each other down
<br/>
reflecting one's fear upon another
<br/>
forcing one to come down
<br/>
onto their level

binding in a cage
<br/>
of limited often single possibilities,

But cougrage isnt present
<br/>
don't ask courage to do what
<br/>
i wont have courage to say that

bounded by my fearless fears
<br/>
and ridlled with the paradox of fears
<br/>
of death and life

                common sense is not present,
                <br/>
when the eyes aren't damaged,
<br/>
but wisdom becomes blind
<br/>
without little damage to the eyes.

                Mirrors on the wall
                <br/>
grew up in it
<br/>
They say reflect,

it does inevitably.
<br/>
respect the man,
<br/>
to look into the mirror.
<br/>
pat yourself on the back,
<br/>
if you can.
<br/><br/>
Lord grant the courage, 
<br/>
to those who shalt lack,
<br/>
tried to focus not in the eyes,
<br/>
but they stared back.
<br/><br/>
Stared back not onto me,
<br/>
but through me.
<br/>
Even i haven't seen that,
<br/>
I guess discovering new me.
<br/>
This new-me got courage,
<br/>
just like young one
<br/>
but, nah — i couldn't be that again,
<br/>
even if i tried. That fearlessness to look back
<br/>
into the mirror again.

                If we're going to die anyway and that too is not in our hands. Then why take it in our hands and do it too soon. Let's say, you sat on a bus that had the most beautiful things in the universe. Everything that you could have possibly imagined in heaven was there, but better. The most wonderful creations of the universe could be seen from that bus. You were not supposed to be on that bus. There was close to no chance that you would have gotten a chance to sit on that bus. But you got lucky. Somehow you did get the chance. Now you are sitting on that bus. You know that bus is going to stop at a certain point. The break is not even in your control. In the way, there were lots of speed breakers and tunnels. And whenever they went through each dark tunnel everyone was bit depressed. Some more, some less. Some people had someone, some did not. But everyone knew that at the end of tunnel was something magical. Something beautiful that they have not seen ever. Something that will make them forget about every dark tunnel they went through. While many thought that the dark tunnel will be there forever. That was a lie they told themself. Every dark tunnel's end was so beautiful. I cannot explain it in words. But some people decide to dropoff the bus in that tunnel. They left the dreams that could have been fulfilled, smiles of their loved ones that could be seen, moments with their friends where they had no sense of time. Their first kiss. Everything. They left all of this for the temporary darkness of a fake tunnel. You tell me is that worth the chance they got to sit on this bus?
