                I wish I was dead and cold,<br/>
seeking validation from my demons<br/>
tried, but could no more hold<br/>
going down spiral my head uphold<br/>
Then, maybe I could have embraced<br/>
sleepless nights in my bed,<br/>
love and hate, only in my head,<br/>
uninterested talks with my friend.<br/>
All went down in drain,<br/>
when I lost to myself<br/>
and my pain<br/>
</p>

                Can't take back the love that I gave you,
                <br/>
Surely, it was me, not you.
<br/>
Staring in the abyss,
<br/>
not to find myself but you
<br/>
Came back from darkness,
<br/>
hoping for ecstacy to come and find me.
<br/>
Letting go could be an act of kindness,<br/>

maybe for you, but not for me. <br/>

After, essence of life was lost,<br/>

thought, I could find that myself.<br/>

Turns out, essence was you<br/>

                Let me try,
                <br/>
don't stop, bind or catch me
<br/>
let me fly.
<br/>
Without any awareness, only ignorance
<br/>
you are binding me in invisible chain.
<br/>
Dare you do that to my playfulness,
<br/>
hoping for life to come and find me in my pain.
<br/>
Not leap of ignorance but of faith.
<br/>
Trust me, and I will try,
<br/>
not to disappoint you or make you cry
<br/>
But at least let me try
