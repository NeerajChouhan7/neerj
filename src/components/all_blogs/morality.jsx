            You don’t trust people because they are trustworthy. You do it because you have nothing else to rely on.
<br /><br/>
SPOILER ALERT: Of course (duh) don't read if you want to watch the show OR in between the show. Finish it before reading any further. Also, a minor minor spoiler of Breaking Bad is also included but it won't spoil anything more than few minutes of the first episode. If you're too much stubborn about knowing nothing about the show before watching then don't go ahead.
<br /><br/>
BUT if you don't give any damn about the show but just want to read something on morals, then please go ahead. Here’s a short summary for you about what the show is to set enough context: People with huge debt or extreme poverty are put together under one roof to play games in order to win a hefty sum of money. There are 6 games, which everyone used to play in childhood. Catch is that if you lose, you die and there are close to no rules. Now let's get into the piece:
<br /><br/>
Squid game is all about moral and survival instincts. It oscillates between foreshadowing humans as animals and humans. They show that like animals, survival takes over any moral ground. As we witnessed, all rules of moral judgment were broken by the players when it came to their survival. Survival preceded the judgment of right and wrong. It always does, in animals. While as a human, morals stand above everything else and that's what makes them human, the belief in humanity itself. Otherwise, we all be killing each other, and people who are running the game know this. That's why they let people who are morally weak play the game. Being gangsters and in huge debt is a succession of losing morals and ethics, mostly. While it has people who are morally weak and choose survival over anything, the show never misses leaving the story in a moral grey area.
<br /><br/>
As a viewer, you do not like anyone because you cannot like anyone in the show. Everyone is doing what's good for them because otherwise, they'd die, right. Now assuming you are a good human being, you don't want them or anyone to die. And you also don't want them to kill or take immoral steps in order to win, to live. Humans want to make sense of everything, choose sides but the Squid game doesn't let you take one.
<br /><br/>
Because it quite literally becomes matter of life and death. It plays on moral ambiguity. That's what makes everyone so interested in this show and hooks them till the end. The best parallel I could think of this is Breaking Bad, where he has literally the same need for money and do things to fulfill that requirement. Throughout the show, you cannot decide what he's doing is right or wrong. That's why the show itself decides it for you, with the help of his wife Skyler, her sister, and Mike. And what happens with each of them in the end.
<br /><br/>
In the end, even after winning or because of winning Gi-hun (Player 456) loses the faith in humanity. Despite being a person with the highest moral ground in those 456 people, he is devastated now. For 1 year, he was back where he was before the game, even more miserable. Despite having everything, he lost one thing he had: his faith. His belief in humanity is lost. After talking to Il-nam(Player 01) on his deathbed, he realized that he still has some amount of faith left in him. He took the bet on a drunk man covered in snow with the old man because he wants to realize that he still have that faith. By proving to him that humanity is still alive, he wants to make himself alive. At that moment, by winning that bet, he wins. But they both win, this time. Il-nam wins too. He dies before watching the policemen come over to help the drunk man. While the whole show was between those two people, one who believed humans are inherently good, the other who believed that humans are inherently evil. Both won in the end or none of them did. Again, as the rest of the show, leaving you in the moral gray area.
We will soon be able to see the full picture of the potential of Metaverse. Many environments and situations in the current world will be shifted to completely virtual ones. This shift can possibly take some time, but it is inevitable. Even right now, offices and schools are remote. People meet with each other virtually. Employees & students won't hesitate to move to an AR/VR office and school. Who doesn't love to have fun at work or while studying? On the other hand, world-famous artists like Travis Scott are already doing concerts in a multiplayer game. The only thing that is left right now is the adoption of the hardware.
