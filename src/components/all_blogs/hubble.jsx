                <h5>Introduction</h5>
<br />
As a fellow crypto enthusiast, you know how the blockchain space has grown over the years. Especially with projects such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and recently, Solana. If you hold any of these projects’ tokens, you know that over time they have provided excellent exponential gains. Such lucrative returns not only fuel the investments but also the investor’s greed which isn’t necessarily a wrong thing. Investing in these coins sounds like a no-brainer at the moment. But once you do that, and the next day there is a new project in town with more promising gains, how do you take advantage of it and maximize your gains while not missing out on the opportunity? 

<br />
<br />
You might want to sell the long-term bag of the coins you hold and invest it in the newer project to later come back to the former one. But this process exposes you to the market change within that time window and can cost you a lot of your gains. When the opportunity cost is so high on either side what can you do to prevent losing out on it?

<br />
<br />
Enter Hubble, a protocol built on the Solana blockchain to increase your liquidity up to 11x. What better than a stable coin to make new coin purchases. What it essentially does is, provide you with a loan for you to make new purchases against the coins you already have. But wait, wouldn’t the loan drown you in its interest percentage when you try to return it? Well, good news, Hubble only charges a 0.5% upfront fee and makes the whole lending process at a 0% interest rate making your next purchase easy and stress-free. 
<br />
<br />
<h5>What exactly is Hubble?</h5>
<br />

Hubble is a smart contract protocol that exists within the Solana ecosystem. It is a multi-asset protocol that supercharges your liquidity (increasing it up to 110%!).
<br />
<br />
The idea behind it is really simple yet so powerful and efficient. Hubble unlocks liquidity for the Solana ecosystem. Let’s understand it with an example:
<br />
<br />
Suppose you are an investor with a maintained portfolio of coins such as BTC, ETH, SOL. You want to purchase a new coin in town promising exponential returns in a matter of a few weeks.
<br />
<br />
What you can do is sell your current portfolio for stable coins such as USDC or USDT and convert them into new coins. You might even be tempted to do so, but is it feasible enough in this volatile market where the prices jump up and down by as much as 100% within a single day? No, right. Hubble solves this. You bring your assets to the protocol and deposit them as collateral. The protocol will use the collateral to provide you with its own stable coin USDH. You can claim as much as 11 times the collateral amount. You can then go ahead and buy the new coin using this USDH and when you get your returns from the promised platform, you can redeposit the loan amount at no extra cost and the profit will be all yours to keep.
<br />
<br />
Brilliant, right? You get to liquidate your assets without actually selling them. What more could you ask for? But wait, there’s more, you also get a yield on your deposited amount that you lock as collateral. They already have 4 yield protocols for Solana and 3 for Bitcoin using which they can choose the best platform for you to get the maximum possible yields daily and thereby optimizing your gains.
<br />
<br />
The protocol is ever-growing and the new tokens will be added to be accepted as collateral as the platform grows. The complete development of this protocol is still just Phase 1.
<br />
<br />
There will be Phase 2 dedicated to creating a treasury of the protocol’s native token HBB. So that it can be lent to the users for practices such as options strategy trading. Phase 3 will focus more on the collateralization problem and bridge the trust gap between the borrower and the lender.
<br />
<br />
Initially, Hubble will launch the borrowing protocol, later evolving into a more utility-
<br />
<br />

<h5>Why the Solana ecosystem?</h5>
Solana is a user-friendly, scalable solution for all smart contracts and dApps. It is one of the most efficient chains in terms of speed, time, and fees. When you need the best yields for your collateral, you need a trustable and fast chain for smoother transactions. 
<br />
<br />
Solana also has a good UX and is cheaper compared to other such platforms. Also, there is a lot of trust in this project. Now, for other chains, you’ll have to trade your SOL for USDC to invest in other strategies like futures, options as margin. But Hubble being present in the ecosystem helps in a way so that you won’t have to sell your SOL anymore and you can just borrow funds against it while staying on the platform itself.
<br />
<br />
<h5>Key Features </h5>
As we saw earlier, Hubble protocols work in phases. Currently, phase 1 is going on. In which they aim to build infrastructure for borrowing and lending with a primary focus on borrowing. They are focusing on enabling users to unlock liquidity, increase capital efficiency and earn yield at the same time. As we already discussed, they do this with a bunch of exciting features like 0.5% fees, USDH stablecoin, multiple asset collateral, and zero-interest loans. We will dive into each of them, but first, let’s get the picture of borrowing on Hubble protocol:
<br />
<br />
<h5>
Borrowing</h5>
<br />
Right now, Hubble is offering low-cost and capital-efficient borrowing. They allow a generous 110% collateral ratio for borrowing, whereas other protocols require 150% or more for borrowing. It also doesn’t charge interest rates and requires a payment due date, meaning you can repay the amount at any time. Unless you borrow more USDH.
<br />
<br />
Hubble also enables a single user to become both lender and borrower, at the same time. While your collateral is ensuring the security of the user's loan, it’s earning yield and paying the debt also. Users can increase their deposited amount by choosing a yield strategy for their assets while they borrow. The debt remains the same. But as a self-repaying borrowing position, your collateral value increases. In the future, protocol looks to explore self-repaying loans too.
<br />
<br />
On top of all that, since protocol only charges the user once. Users can increase their leverage position without incurring the borrowing cost. So, to increase your leverage in the market, you deposit $1000 in ETH and take a loan. With that loan amount, you buy some more ETH and deposit them and rinse and repeat. That way, you can increase your collateral exposure and could gain up to 11x leverage.
<br />
<br />
From a protocol perspective, sitting idle with a blockchain asset is not the smartest strategy. So, Hubble partners with protocols across Solana to deploy collateral and earn yield for users.
<br />
<br />
Across, phases 2 and 3, Hubble will introduce products like capital-protected notes by combining PoS yield and options combined with vanilla lending and undercollateralized bond issues.
<br />
<br />
Let’s take a loan against your SOL in Hubble:
<br />
<br />
The user has added 100 SOL as collateral and they can take out 3000 USDH. A fee of 0.5% is distributed among HBB holders and added to the debt.
<br />
<br />
<h5>Multiple asset collateral</h5>
<br />

On Hubble, holders of six assets: SOL, ETH, BTC, FTT, RAY, and SRM, can lock their holdings. The protocol will issue USDH, which they can use to invest, spend or stake somewhere else to earn more yield.
<br />
<br />
Since Hubble allows you to deposit multiple assets as collateral. It decreases users' liquidation risk because the volatility risk will be distributed among multiple assets. So, the decrease in the value of one of the assets won’t affect the liquidation of the user's assets. The basic don’t put your eggs in one basket situation.
<br />
<br />
Hubble’s main value proposition is that it unlocks liquidity. How exactly? Let’s understand this with an example:
<br />
<br />
Suppose, you hold 2 ETH, 5 BTC & 200 SOL and you wish to hold them long-term and not sell any of them. But right now, there’s an exciting NFT project and you want to get involved in it. To solve that dilemma, you can deposit your assets as collateral, earn interest and get USDH stablecoin.
<br />
<br />
The maximum collateral that you can get on top of your assets is 110% of your asset value. Also called the collateral ratio, which is calculated by collateral value/loan value.
<br />
<br />
<h5>HBB Token</h5>
<br />
Hubble has their native value-accruing coin called HBB. Hubble distributes major revenue to the community, by allowing them to earn by staking their HBB token. 
<br />
<br />
It is a fee-sharing protocol. 85% of the revenue is distributed to users who stake their HBB. This revenue comes from the 0.5% fee for minting USDH and the 0.5% fee for redeeming USDH as collateral. Protocols look forward to exposing HBB stakers to additional revenue streams in the future.
<br />
<br />

<h5>Governance and DAO</h5>
<br />

HBB is also a governance token for Hubble. Which allows users to vote on proposals and propose ideas for the protocol, with other governance activities. Once the protocol decentralizes and forms a DAO, the community will be in charge of the treasury. Right now, 15% of the revenue goes towards the protocol’s treasury.
<br />
<br />

Hubble’s roadmap includes implementing the governance in a completely decentralized format. Hubble started as a centralized entity and is moving slowly towards full decentralization, a situation where decision-making and protocol changes are handed over to the community. Right now, protocol suggests two types of proposal where the community will be able to vote on:
<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>

Executable code proposals: Consisting of the majority of the proposals, implemented by the community and, upon successful voting, will be swapped out for the old programs.
    </li>
    <br />
<br />
<li>

General directive proposals: Once a quarter for part of developers’ time will be dedicated to community-driven decisions, subject to the previous quarter’s directive being completed.
</li>

</ul>
<br />
<br />

Governance will follow typical community voting. Where HBB holders will have the power to vote initially. Then slowly it will be granted to USDH holders, Liquidity Pools for HBB or USDH providers, or open Debt Position holders.
<br />
<br />
<h6>USDH</h6>
Hubble solved the huge problem of unlocking liquidity in the Solana ecosystem. USDH, which was 100% decentralized stablecoin on Solana, played an important role in that. It is backed, at least 150%, by a basket of assets such as SOL, BTC, ETH, and FTT. 
<br />
<br />
To keep USDH pegged to the dollar, Hubble incentivizes arbitrageurs to keep it pegged with 1:1 value with USD. They allow face value redemption of USDH by trading on platforms like Saber. To be able to do this with Solana's speeds means that USDH should remain tightly pegged.
<br />
<br />
To understand this with examples, let’s say if USDH falls to 0.95 USD in market value, any user can purchase 95 USDH from the market and redeem that for $100 worth of any asset on Hubble. This burns USDH as it is received to quickly raise USDH’s value back to USD.
<br />
<br />
<h5>Community</h5>
<br />
Hubble protocol has a very active Discord server. Devs keep updating and solving people’s queries on the server itself. Telegram and Twitter are pretty active too, with over 19 thousand followers on Twitter, providing users with regular updates about the protocol. The discord community itself is over 7000 members, growing significantly as we speak.
<br />
<br />
The regular interactions on these platforms are really helpful for growing the community and making more people aware of the protocol.
<br />
<br />

<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<br />
It is no doubt now that Hubble protocol is solving a huge problem here. Their vision and approach towards bringing liquidity to users seem promising for the Solana and Defi ecosystem.
<br />
<br />
Liquidity is every user’s pain point in interacting with Defi protocols. They need products that can solve these pain points and even benefit users upon using them. Hubble has so far been able to perfectly solve this. 
<br />
<br />
In 2022, the Solana Defi ecosystem will be a thing to watch out for. And it is of no doubt that the Hubble protocol is going to play a significant role in that. Super excited to see future product developments and innovations by Hubble!
