The only way you can live fully is by realizing death.
<br />
<br />
I have so much to say on this. But out of all the things that have become “sensitive” today in the world. To me, death feels like something I would rather discuss in a personal conversation.
<br />
<br />
But ironically, this is rather an under-discussed thing. Like every other big truth in life, this is also a paradox, I know. To process the fact that THIS is all you have got, the only one chance, one bet, one day, one moment is pretty fucking hard.
<br />
<br />
The reason behind seating on the couch is not that you want comfort. That’s rather a simplification. It is that you have not realized that THIS is all you have got. There is no other chance. No second life.
<br />
<br />
I am nobody to say it but Confucius guy was so fucking on point with -- “Every man has two lives, and the second starts when he realizes he has just one”

As you may saw in the last piece, I wrote about being great. One of the greatest, to be precise. I am self-aware of the importance of action and ideas in this context.
<br />
<br />
I think it’s about patience for those who are still fucking around and finding out what they are good at.
<br />
<br />
Yeah, some lucky ones find BasketBall at 7 and decide that this is going to be everything in their life from now on. Range by David Epstein explores this concept furthermore.
<br />
<br />
But many of the great people did not know their "passion" for the longest time. Still, those people still became one of the greatest. They were not late, per se. Because over the period, they built their intuition. They knew when to strike when to seize the opportunity, to be patient, to hustle and when to rest.
<br />
<br />
There were hundreds of prodigies in the news who are nowhere to be heard of now. Robert Kroc started Mcdonald's at 54. You can be early, sometimes. But you are never late.

I hate watches with tick-tick-tick sounds.
<br />
<br />
Watches in which the seconds-hand stops for a fraction of a second in each second to make the ‘tick’ sound. They feed you that time stops. While you and I both know it doesn’t.
<br />
<br />
It makes you believe in a lie. You start believing it and act like you got very much time here on this earth. To be fair, it actually seems like the second-hand stops more than it moves.
<br />
<br />
I mean stopping 60 times in 60 seconds is a little too much don’t you think.

Let me tell you a secret about humans. Which you probably already know.
<br />
<br />
Everyone, you, me, and umm…your dog, understand themselves by the expression on other people’s faces.
<br />
<br />
Of course, it lies in nurturing. When a child assesses its own activities based on the facial reaction of the parents. Because they do not have the tool of language at that moment. In conversations, we assess what we said based on the subtle signals in body language and facial reactions of another person.
<br />
<br />
Eyes speak way louder than mouth.

Stories run the world.
<br />
<br />
The mediums keep changing and taking different shapes. But at the base of it, humans use each and every tool to propagate stories. Person who controls the stories of the world controls it, as well as the humans. It is quite difficult to fathom this since not many people would agree with that. Good storytelling will make you not question its authenticity. From love to gang rivalries, dragons to time travel, the 17th century to 2050. Good storytelling can give you an experience of all that.
<br />
<br />
It is very fascinating to me that it is nothing but stories that makes identity. We form our identity based on the story we tell ourselves. That particular story is the articulation of our life to ourselves. And we are both the protagonist and antagonist of that story.
<br />
<br />
Because stories are the best way to experience reality without bearing pain.
<br />

There was one common thing that every teenager got from covid lockdown — an internet friend. An "URL friend”.
<br />
<br />
Not being able to socialize forced everyone to find their tribe in the second world: the internet. Everyone was almost always on the Internet at that time. From Twitter to Instagram, from Snapchat to Discord, from Zoom to Fortnite. We all found our versions of digital socializing. Attending infinite events and calls to hurt our jaws with that constant smile. Albeit, that period was memorable.
<br />
<br />
Even if we are not in person together, we know every single thing about each other. The fine line between IRL friendships & URL friendships is almost faded now. Everyone can ensure that even though this person is not here but the friendship real and honest. They are no more or less than any other IRL friend.

There is a kind of suffocation. One where you can breathe pretty normally. Your lungs have air, your nose is inhaling and exhaling like any other night. Just that you feel like there is a huge stone on your chest. You cannot really point where exactly. But somewhere in middle, below the ribs.

Many like to call it a void. I don’t agree so. It’s not empty space. It is denser than most objects in the universe. Filled deeply, densely with my feelings, emotions, and to be particular, melancholy. The reason why that suffocation is the same for different kinds of melancholy is to tell us that no matter the situation, you fought with similar courage as ever.
