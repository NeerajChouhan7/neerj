            Truth begets serendipity and luck is nothing but serendipity in disguise.
<br /><br/>
This post was two separate posts. One about truth and another one about honoring your commitments. But midway through both of them, I realized that both coexist and are interdependent. You cannot honor your commitments if you are not truthful. And vice-versa.
<br /><br/>
Now, I would be narcissistic to talk about the truth. Because knowingly and unknowingly, I have lied. Like every other human being. But for sake of this, assume you wrote this.

<br /><br/>
As we all know, people rarely tell truth. A better saying would be people who tell the truth are rare. Because we are too afraid of the consequences of it. Which in most cases is a tough conversation or confrontation. With the risk of sounding Peterson-y, I would say that the truth must be said. In the grand scheme, people are looking for other people who can tell truth to them. Because everyone is telling themselves lie and living in their own little fantasies. A person living outside their head is, no doubt, the happiest person alive. But we aren’t monks and as the old saying goes, truth is bitter.
<br /><br/>
People who tell the truth are prone to hate more. Because they make people come out of their fantasies. They make another person uncomfortable, which is a prerequisite for growth. Nobody wants discomfort. I mean, you would most likely agree that most people would cut out a friendship rather than have a tough conversation to save it. When the cost is yours to bear in telling the truth, most people back off.
<br /><br/>
As you know, you're the easiest person to fool. So once you learn to tell truth to yourself, you will, by all means, will say the truth to others. And that comes from honoring your commitments. First, learn to honor your commitments to yourself. If you said to do something to yourself, do it no matter what. Once you have had enough repetitions of honoring your own commitments, you learn to honor the commitments of other people. That's actually a formula for respect and reputation too.
<br /><br/>
It's easier to break a reputation than build one. You can ruin your reputation by not honoring your commitments. By saying to someone you will do X and then doing it will make you stand apart. Your friendships will blossom. Uninvited chaos in relationships would be invisible. It’s that simple. Saying something and doing it is so rare nowadays. Because everyone is kings and queens of their words but no one is of their actions. Most people are all talk, no show. While on the other hand, if you do the opposite it’s going to damage your reputation. Other people may not mention it, but it's gonna reflect in their behavior. It signals to them that you don't even respect yourself, then why would they respect you. Most people have literally nothing to give, but their word. And when you don't honor your word, you are disrespecting the other person and yourself too.
<br /><br/>
As you grow up, you realize the difference between a person in power and a person without power is their word. Ever wondered why some people's words have more power than others? Because they first told themself a lie, which eventually becomes the truth. It's a sweet paradox. But this is the way, reality works.
<br /><br/>
The respect truth earns you is impeccable. And long-term games are always played with people who are truthful. That is also why giving something in writing was worth so much, back in the day. It shows commitment. First, you've put extra effort by writing, for them. Second, it concretes the thoughts in your head about what do you want to do.
<br /><br/>
Thriller writer Dan Brown talks about this in terms of contracts. In a book, especially a thriller, the author makes contracts with the reader. The author makes several promises to a reader. Which the author has to fulfill by the end of that book. It builds credibility and trust towards the author. If the author doesn't keep those promises, then the reader would have an awful experience. The reader would lose all trust in the author.
<br /><br/>
We are biological creatures at the end of the day. We operate, make decisions based on other people's reputations. Our relationship depends upon your reputation in my circle and my eyes. No doubt about that. You build that relationship through honoring your commitment, standing up to your word. That's it.
<br /><br/>
When you respect other people's time, it shows how much you do your own. That builds instant credibility. Unlike, the opposite would lose any credibility you got. What's even more interesting is that, if you respect your own word. You don't even have to worry about anything else. We do work based on reputation. If your reputation is impeccable, everyone wants to work with you. People will bring you opportunities. You can navigate your whole professional life by this.
<br /><br/>
There are infinite benefits of being the person who honors their own commitments. While severe downside in not being one. It's rare that people realize this early on.
<br /><br/>
If you zoom out a little bit, see for yourself what kind of relationship you would be building if it's built upon lies. Only and only truth begets serendipity. Once you understand the miracles of serendipity, you would understand the importance of truth too.
